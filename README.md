# Smart Home Blinds
This is the source code to my diy smart home blinds project. It's written using Platformio (C++) and is designed to run on an ESP32. The Smart Home connection is established via SinricPro.

The acceleraton and deceleration functions can be adjusted in the [Lookups.cpp](src/Lookups.cpp). The currently used function can be seen on [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/xbeevkr9).
